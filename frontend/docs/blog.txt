Building an IO game - things I wish I knew

- Realtime multiplayer is hard - but you will land on your feet
- Choose a framework that works for you
- The importance of building a shared folder first - duplicating code for client / server is frustrating and tiresome
- Make an effort to understand client side prediction, server reconciliation + entity interpolation from the start
- Read the important guides on multiplayer
- Study how others are doing it
- Join a forum - make friends with the regulars
- DOn't be afraid to just dig in.. you learn the most from mistakes, it can be tempting to re-write agains every cool abstraction you see
for entity interpolation etc, but try and resist until you're really tidying up
- there's a LOT of work - get a plan together straight away, see what the 80/20 place looks like , don't get caught in the details in V1
